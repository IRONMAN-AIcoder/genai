        "\"KnowLaw\" is an AI-driven legal document assistant designed to enhance the efficiency of legal research and analysis. The system utilizes advanced natural language processing (NLP) techniques to process a variety of legal documents, such as text files, Word documents, and PDFs, and provide insightful answers to legal queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "At its core, this project combines document retrieval and generative models to create a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system. It uses vector search with embeddings to identify relevant sections from legal documents and then generates answers by leveraging OpenRouter's GPT model, trained on legal and conversational data.\n",
        "\n",
        "This tool is aimed at making legal professionals' tasks faster and more accurate by allowing them to query a vast repository of legal information. Whether it‚Äôs for lawyers, researchers, or students, \"KnowLaw\" simplifies the process of extracting useful legal knowledge from extensive document archives."
